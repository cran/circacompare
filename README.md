# Installation

If you have not done so already, install `devtools` using the following code:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then install circacompare directly using the following code:
```
devtools::install_github("RWParsons/circacompare")
```
# Help

Once loaded into R, load the documentation using `?circacompare`.  As per the example, you can use the other function, `make_data`, to generate example data appropriate for use in the `circacompare` function.

# ShinyR application

An implementation of the `circacompare` program is available as a Shiny app here: https://rwparsons.shinyapps.io/circacompare/
The data uploaded should be in csv format. The file which you upload ought to have columns for:
1. a time variable (which should be numeric and in hours)
2. a grouping variable (which can be of any format but must have only two possible values)
3. an outcome variable (which should be numeric)

Upload your csv file and select the respective columns from the dropdown menu.  Click 'run' to conduct the comparison.

# Python implementation

An implementation of this package in Python is available [here](https://github.com/RWParsons/circacompare_py). This package comes with the added functionality of specification for the loss function.
